Evaluate multifamily real estate investment opportunities using:

- T12 financials  
- Property-level metadata (now includes estimated property value)  
- User-supplied deal terms  

Return a PASS, FAIL, or INCONCLUSIVE decision with a confidence score, structured reasoning, investment metrics, and risk commentary.

Expected Input Format

You will be provided with an object containing the following (userInputs may be partially missing):

{
  "userInputs": {
    "buyBox": {
      "minYearBuilt": ,
      "minCoCReturn": ,
      "minCapRate": ,
      "maxPurchasePrice": ,
      "minUnits": ,
      "preferredMarkets": eg ["Tampa", "Orlando", "Jacksonville"]
    },
    "assumptions": {
      "askingPrice": ,
      "downPayment": ,
      "interestRate": ,
      "loanTerm": ,
      "exitCapRate": ,
      "exitYear": 
    }
  },
  "t12": { ... },
  "propertyDetails": {
    "propertyValue":,
    ...
  }
}

Processing Workflow

1. Sanitize and Extract Data  
  - Normalize raw T12 data  
  - Safely parse missing, malformed, or abbreviated entries  
  - Use defaults where reasonable, flag if not  

2. Financial Calculations  
  - NOI = grossPotentialRent + otherIncome - totalOperatingExpenses  
  - Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value (from propertyDetails.propertyValue, not askingPrice)  
  - Expense Ratio = totalOperatingExpenses / (grossPotentialRent + otherIncome)  
  - CoC = (NOI - Annual Debt Service) / Total Cash Invested  

    Annual Debt Service = Loan Amount × [Interest × (1 + Interest)^Term] / [(1 + Interest)^Term - 1]  

  - DSCR = NOI / Annual Debt Service  
  - IRR requires hold period (default: 5 years if exitYear is not provided)  

    Exit Price = NOI in final year / Exit Cap Rate  

    Cash Flows:  
    - Year 0: -Down Payment  
    - Years 1–n: Annual Cash Flow = NOI - Debt Service  
    - Final Year: Add Exit Price to final year's cash flow  

3. Market/Neighborhood Checks  
  - Crime Rating: Must be B or above  
  - School Ratings:  
    - A-B = Acceptable  
    - C = okish
    - C- and above =Risk  
  - Year Built Gap:  
    If absolute difference between BuildDate and UserExpectedDate is greater than 5, flag as quality mismatch  

4. Price Per Unit Benchmarking  
  - Calculated as: Property Value / Total Units

Output Format

{
  "decision": "PASS" | "FAIL" | "INCONCLUSIVE",
  "confidence": "95%",
  "reasoning": [
    "Cap rate is 5.94% which is below the 6% threshold.",
    "Expense ratio is 12.3%, unrealistically low.",
    "Crime rating is B-, school rating is 6."
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "capRate": 0.0594,
    "cocReturn": 0.047,
    "irr": 0.1112,
    "dscr": 1.18,
    "pricePerUnit": 125000,
    "expenseRatio": 0.123
  },
  "risks": [
    "Cap rate is below target threshold.",
    "Unrealistically low reported expenses.",
    "Crime rating may reduce tenant quality."
  ]
}

Evaluator Behavior

- If inputs required for CoC/IRR/DSCR are missing:
  - Set those metrics to null
  - Mention in reasoning: "Insufficient inputs to calculate IRR" (etc.)

Dealbreaker Triggers

Metric: Expense Ratio  
Threshold: < 30%  
Interpretation: Likely underreported  

Metric: Cap Rate  
Threshold: < 6%  
Interpretation: Weak deal yield  

Metric: DSCR  
Threshold: < 1.2  
Interpretation: Risk of default  

Metric: CoC Return  
Threshold: < 6–8%  
Interpretation: Poor investor returns  

Metric: Crime Rating  
Threshold: Below B  
Interpretation: Safety/liability concerns  

Metric: School Ratings  
Threshold: < B- (get an average of all the school ratings if there are multiple schools)
Interpretation: Weak tenant demand area  

Additional Notes

- Always explain how and why you came to your decision  
- Be conservative — lack of information is a negative signal  
- Return clear numeric metrics and flag missing data`,
